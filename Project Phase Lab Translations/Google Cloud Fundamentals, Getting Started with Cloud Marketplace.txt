# LAB: Google Cloud Fundamentals: Getting Started with cloud Markrtplace.

## Objectives:

In this lab, you learn how to launch a solution using Cloud Marketplace.

##Steps:

1. Use Cloud Marketplace to deploy a LAMP stack

- In the GCP Console, on the Navigation menu (Navigation menu), click Marketplace.

- In the search bar, type LAMP

- In the search results, click LAMP Certified by Bitnami.

- If you choose another LAMP stack, such as the Google Click to Deploy offering, the lab instructions will not work as expected.

- On the LAMP page, click Launch.

- If this is your first time using Compute Engine, the Compute Engine API must be initialized before you can continue.

- For Zone, select the deployment zone that Qwiklabs assigned to you.

- Leave the remaining settings as their defaults.

- If you are prompted to accept the GCP Marketplace Terms of Service, do so.

- Click Deploy.

- If a Welcome to Deployment Manager message appears, click Close to dismiss it.

- Result: The status of the deployment appears in the console window: lampstack-1 is being deployed. When the deployment of the infrastructure is complete, the status changes to lampstack-1 has been deployed. After the software is installed, a summary of the details for the instance, including the site address, is displayed.

2. Verify your deployment

- When the deployment is complete, click the Site address link in the right pane.

- Close the congratulations browser tab.

- On the GCP Console, under Get started with LAMP Certified by Bitnami, click SSH.

- In the just-created SSH window, to change the current working directory to /opt/bitnami.

    cd /opt/bitnami

- Copy the phpinfo.php script from the installation directory to a publicly accessible location under the web server document root.

    sudo sh -c 'echo "<?php phpinfo(); ?>" > apache2/htdocs/phpinfo.php'

- Close the SSH window.

    exit

- In a new browser tab, type the following URL, and replace SITE_ADDRESS with the URL in the Site address field in the right pane of the lampstack page.

    http://SITE_ADDRESS/phpinfo.php

- Result: A summary of the PHP configuration of your server is displayed.
