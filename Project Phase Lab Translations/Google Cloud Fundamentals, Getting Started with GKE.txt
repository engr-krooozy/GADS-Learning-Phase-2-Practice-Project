# LAB: Google Cloud Fundamentals: Getting Started with GKE

## Objectives:

In this lab, you will learn how to perform the following tasks:

-Provision a Kubernetes cluster using Kubernetes Engine.

-Deploy and manage Docker containers using kubectl.

## Steps:

1. Confirm that needed APIs are enabled

- In the GCP Console, on the Navigation menu, click APIs & Services.

- Scroll down in the list of enabled APIs, and confirm that both of these APIs are enabled:

    -Kubernetes Engine API
    
    -Container Registry API

- If either API is missing, click Enable APIs and Services at the top. Search for the above APIs by name and enable each for your current project.

2. Start a Kubernetes Engine cluster

    - Place the zone that Qwiklabs assigned you to into an environment variable called MY_ZONE with the command below:
    
        export MY_ZONE=us-central1-a 

    - Start a Kubernetes cluster managed by Kubernetes Engine. Name the cluster webfrontend and configure it to run 2 nodes with the command below:

        gcloud container clusters create webfrontend --zone $MY_ZONE --num-nodes 2

    - After the cluster is created, check your installed version of Kubernetes using the kubectl version command:

        kubectl version

    - View your running nodes in the GCP Console. On the Navigation menu (Navigation menu), click Compute Engine > VM Instances.

3. Run and deploy a container

    - launch a single instance of the nginx container using the command below:

        kubectl create deploy nginx --image=nginx:1.17.10

    - View the pod running the nginx container using the command below:

        kubectl get pods

    - Expose the nginx container to the Internet using the command below:

        kubectl expose deployment nginx --port 80 --type LoadBalancer

    - View the new service using the command below:

        kubectl get services

    - Open a new web browser tab and paste your cluster's external IP address into the address bar. The default home page of the Nginx browser is displayed.

    - Scale up the number of pods running on your service using the command below:

        kubectl scale deployment nginx --replicas 3

    - Confirm that Kubernetes has updated the number of pods using the command below:

        kubectl get pods

    - Confirm that your external IP address has not changed using the command below:

        kubectl get services

    - Return to the web browser tab in which you viewed your cluster's external IP address. Refresh the page to confirm that the nginx web server is still responding.

    - Well done, you have just completed the Google Cloud Fundamentals: Getting Started with GKE LAB.
